Bugs

Fixed a bug with the score. The score would be added up correctly but when viewed in the highscore page, it would show a correctly random score. I fixed this issue by console logging each section but couldn't not find the issue after doing some research i found that using submit sometimes can change what you are asking it do it so I changed the save from a submit to a button and this has seems to work.
